    This function uses the YuNet AI model to find faces in an image.
    Think of it like a smart assistant that can point to where faces are located
    in a photo and tell you how confident it is about each detection.
    The function returns the coordinates (positions) of detected faces in a specific
    format that the face_recognition library can understand.
    Parameters:
    - image: The photo to analyze
    - detector: The YuNet AI model 
    - conf_threshold: Minimum confidence (0.9 = 90%) to accept a face detection

        Think of it like creating a unique fingerprint for each face.

Now we save all the face encodings and names to a file so they can be used later.
Think of this like saving a phone book to disk so you can look up numbers later.
The pickle format is Python's way of saving complex data structures to files.

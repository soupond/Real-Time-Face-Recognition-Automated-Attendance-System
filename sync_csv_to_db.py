'''
This script synchronizes attendance data from a CSV file to a SQLite database.
It reads the CSV file (like an Excel spreadsheet) and copies the data into a database.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
1. Reads attendance data from a CSV file
2. Connects to a SQLite database
3. Updates or inserts attendance records in the database
4. Ensures both CSV and database have the same information

WHY THIS IS NEEDED because: If we make any changes to the csv file, then we can run this code and ensure same data is updated in the database. 
'''
import sqlite3  # Import sqlite3 for database operations - this handles the database connection
import csv  # Import csv for reading CSV files - this reads Excel-like files
import os  # Import os for file system operations - this checks if files exist

CSV_FILE = 'attendance_log.csv'  # Path to the CSV file containing attendance data
DB_PATH = 'database/attendance.db'  # Path to the SQLite database file
'''
Main function that synchronizes CSV data to the database.
This function does all the work of copying data from CSV to database.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Checks if both CSV file and database exist
2. Reads all data from the CSV file
3. For each person's attendance record, updates the database
4. Handles both new records and updates to existing records

        return  # Exit the function
    if not os.path.exists(DB_PATH):  # Check if the database file doesn't exist

    Read all data from the CSV file into memory.
    This loads the entire attendance spreadsheet so we can process it.

    Validate the CSV format.
    The CSV must have at least 3 columns: Name, Date, and at least one appearance.

    Process each row of attendance data (skip the header row).
    For each person's daily attendance, extract their name, date, and Appearances...

            continue  # Skip this row as the data is incomplete and go to the next one
        name = row[0].strip()  # Get person's name and remove leading and trailing whitespace spaces

        times = [t.strip() for t in row[2:] if t.strip()]  # Get all non-empty time entries after skipping first two columns i.e., name and date. if t.strip(): checks is this value non-empty after removing spaces? But it does not change t itself, t is still the original unstripped string. So we use t.strip() to remove leading/trailing spaces or newlines.
        # Skip rows with missing essential data
        if not name or not date or not times:  # If name, date, or times are missing like if we have name = ''(after strip) , date = ''(after strip) and times = []  (nothing left after stripping). this passes the condition of less than 3 columns becuase it has atleast 3 columns but they are empty.

        Extract first appearance time and last appearance time from all recorded times.

        Update if record exists, insert if it doesn't.
